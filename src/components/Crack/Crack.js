          You and your younger brother both have crypto accounts and wallets
          since you both play crypto games. Your younger brother wants you to
          play his crypto games for more coins but you think you’re wasting time
          if you play games but you don’t earn for your own wallet. The next
          day, in school, while listening to your crypto teacher, she mentioned
          that you can Crack the owner of the wallet but there is some hacking
          involved. With what she said, you immediately got the idea of just
          Cracking your account and your brothers account and play his games.
