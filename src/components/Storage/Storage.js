          In your internship, smart contracts were introduced to you as a simple task for its culminating
          week. Each intern has their own smart contract to solve, and as per the instructions of the game,
          you had to take the ownership of the account and drain the account. While looking at it you notice
          that there are two contracts â€“ the Mine and Storage contract. You were given only until lunch
          break to solve this contract and all that you know is that one of these contracts can only be
          accessed or called through the other contract. The first to be able to accomplish the tasks would
          be given a free lunch from the department, and as competitive as you are, you wanted to win.
